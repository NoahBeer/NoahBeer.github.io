        While you're looking at my resume, please don't hesitate to take a look at my github, which contains multiple projects I have completed throughout college. Also, please take a look at at a web application my partner and I did for our web development course that measures the air quality in places throughout the world using a Google Maps API:<br><a href="https://isaacvraspir.github.io/AirQualityWebApp/index.html">Air Quality Web App<br></a><a href="https://github.com/noahbeer">GitHub</a

<p>My name is Noah Beer and I am a Computer Science Major and Entrepreneurship Minor at the University of St. Thomas in St.
Paul, MN. I am currently a rising senior and will be graduating in the Spring of 2020. I am currently a Software Engineer Intern 
at Equus Compute Solutions in Edina, MN.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:30px;">Personal Life</h2>
<p>I was born on September 29th, 1997 to Richard Beer (father) and Paula Beer (mother) as their first child. A few years down 
the road I became a sibling to Lucas (brother) and Kristina (sister). I attended St. John the Baptist Catholic School in Savage, MN 
from pre-school through 8th grade. After that, I attended Prior Lake High School where I graduated in 2016.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:30px;">Hobbies</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <li>Software Development - Being a Computer Science Major, I have a passion for coding. I enjoy working on my own projects
and messing around with new hardware and software in my free time.</li>
  <li>Hockey - Both playing and watching. I have played since I was 5 and now currently play on the UST Club Hockey Team.
My dad has had season tickets to the Wild since their inaugaral season in 2000, so I love going to Wild games as well.</li>
  <li>Football - Although I was never a big fan of playing football competively, it is still my favorite sport to watch.
I love the Vikings and I love fantasy football.</li>
  <li>Lake Life - Growing up in Prior Lake and having a family cabin less than an hour away, my childhood was forged on 
the water. I love all water sports and enjoying ice cold beer on the lake with family and friends.</li>

a 3 day country music festival in Detroit Lakes, MN.</li>
